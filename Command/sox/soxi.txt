SoXI(1)                         Sound eXchange                         SoXI(1)



NAME
       SoXI - Sound eXchange Information, display sound file metadata

SYNOPSIS
       soxi [-V[level]] [-T] [-t|-r|-c|-s|-d|-D|-b|-B|-e|-a] infile1 ...

DESCRIPTION
       Displays  information  from  the header of a given audio file or files.
       Supported audio file types are listed and  described  in  soxformat(7).
       Note  however, that soxi is intended for use only with audio files with
       a self-describing header.

       By default, as much information as is available is  shown.   An  option
       may  be given to select just a single piece of information (perhaps for
       use in a script or batch-file).

OPTIONS
       -V     Set verbosity. See sox(1) for details.

       -T     Used with multiple files; changes the behaviour of -s, -d and -D
              to  display  the  total  across all given files.  Note that when
              used with -s with files with different sampling rates,  this  is
              of questionable value.

       -t     Show detected file-type.

       -r     Show sample-rate.

       -c     Show number of channels.

       -s     Show number of samples (0 if unavailable).

       -d     Show  duration in hours, minutes and seconds (0 if unavailable).
              Equivalent to number of samples divided by the sample-rate.

       -D     Show duration in seconds (0 if unavailable).

       -b     Show number of bits per sample.

       -B     Show the bitrate averaged over the whole  file  (0  if  unavail-
              able).

       -e     Show the name of the audio encoding.

       -a     Show file comments (annotations) if available.
