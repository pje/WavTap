DESCRIPTION
       libsox  is  a  library  of sound sample file format readers/writers and
       sound effects processors. It is mainly developed for use by SoX but  is
       useful for any sound application.

       sox_format_init  function performs some required initialization related
       to all file format handlers.  If compiled with dynamic library  support
       then  this  will  detect  and  initialize all external libraries.  This
       should be called before any other file operations are performed.

       sox_format_quit function performs some required cleanup related to  all
       file format handlers.

       sox_open_input  function  opens  the file for reading whose name is the
       string pointed to by path and associates an sox_format_t  with  it.  If
       info is non-NULL then it will be used to specify the data format of the
       input file. This is normally only needed  for  headerless  audio  files
       since  the  information  is not stored in the file. If filetype is non-
       NULL then it will be used to specify the file  type.  If  this  is  not
       specified  then  the file type is attempted to be derived by looking at
       the file header and/or the filename extension. A special  name  of  "-"
       can be used to read data from stdin.

       sox_open_output  function  opens the file for writing whose name is the
       string pointed to by path and associates an sox_format_t  with  it.  If
       info is non-NULL then it will be used to specify the data format of the
       output file. Since most file formats can write data in  different  data
       formats,  this  generally  has to be specified. The info structure from
       the input format handler can be specified to copy data over in the same
       format.  If  comment is non-NULL, it will be written in the file header
       for formats that support comments. If filetype is non-NULL then it will
       be  used  to  specify  the file type. If this is not specified then the
       file type is attempted to be derived by looking at the filename  exten-
       sion. A special name of "-" can be used to write data to stdout.

       The function sox_read reads len samples in to buf using the format han-
       dler specified by ft. All data read is converted to 32-bit signed  sam-
       ples  before  being  placed in to buf. The value of len is specified in
       total samples. If its value is not evenly divisable by  the  number  of
       channels, undefined behavior will occur.

       The  function  sox_write  writes  len samples from buf using the format
       handler specified by ft. Data in buf must be 32-bit signed samples  and
       will  be converted during the write process. The value of len is speci-
       fied in total samples. If its value is not evenly divisable by the num-
       ber of channels, undefined behavior will occur.

       The  sox_close  function  dissociates  the  named sox_format_t from its
       underlying file or set of functions. If the format  handler  was  being
       used for output, any buffered data is written first.

       The  function sox_find_effect finds effect name, returning a pointer to
       its sox_effect_handler_t if it exists, and NULL otherwise.

       The  function  sox_create_effect  instantiates   an   effect   into   a
       sox_effect_t  given  a  sox_effect_handler_t *. Any missing methods are
       automatically set to the corresponding nothing method.

       The function sox_effect_options allows passing options into the  effect
       to  control  its  behavior.   It  will return SOX_EOF if there were any
       invalid options  passed  in.   On  success,  the  effp->in_signal  will
       optional contain the rate and channel count it requires input data from
       and effp->out_signal will optionally contain the rate and channel count
       it  outputs  in.  When present, this information should be used to make
       sure appropriate effects are placed in the effects chain to handle  any
       needed conversions.

       Passing  in options is currently only supported when they are passed in
       before the effect is ever started.  The behavior is  undefined  if  its
       called once the effect is started.

       sox_create_effects_chain will instantiate an effects chain that effects
       can be added to.  in_enc and out_enc are the  signal  encoding  of  the
       input and output of the chain respectively.  The pointers to in_enc and
       out_enc are stored internally and so their memory should not be  freed.
       Also, it is OK if their values change over time to reflect new input or
       output encodings as they are referenced only as effects start up or are
       restarted.

       sox_delete_effects_chain will release any resources reserved during the
       creation of the chain.  This will also call sox_delete_effects  if  any
       effects are still in the chain.

       sox_add_effect  adds  an  effect  to the chain.  in specifies the input
       signal info for this effect.  out is a suggestion as to what the output
       signal  should  be but depending on the effects given options and on in
       the effect can choose to do  differently.   Whatever  output  rate  and
       channels  the  effect does produce are written back to in.  It is meant
       that in be stored and passed to each new call to sox_add_effect so that
       changes will be propagated to each new effect.

       SoX  includes  skeleton  C  files  to assist you in writing new formats
       (skelform.c) and effects (skeleff.c). Note that new formats  can  often
       just deal with the header and then use raw.c's routines for reading and
       writing.

       example0.c and example1.c are a good starting point to see how to write
       applications using libsox.  sox.c itself is also a good reference.


RETURN VALUE
       Upon successful completion sox_open_input and sox_open_output return an
       sox_format_t (which is a pointer).  Otherwise, NULL is returned.  TODO:
       Need a way to return reason for failures. Currently, relies on sox_warn
       to print information.

       sox_read and sox_write return the number of samples  successfully  read
       or  written.  If  an  error  occurs, or the end-of-file is reached, the
       return value is a short item count or SOX_EOF. TODO: sox_read does  not
       distiguish  between  end-of-file and error. Need an feof() and ferror()
       concept to determine which occured.

       Upon successful completion sox_close returns 0. Otherwise,  SOX_EOF  is
       returned. In either case, any further access (including another call to
       sox_close()) to the handler results in undefined behavior. TODO: Need a
       way  to  return  reason  for failures. Currently, relies on sox_warn to
       print information.

       Upon successful completion sox_seek returns 0.  Otherwise,  SOX_EOF  is
       returned. TODO Need to set a global error and implement sox_tell.

       TODO

INTERNALS
       SoX's  formats  and  effects  operate with an internal sample format of
       signed 32-bit integer.  The data processing routines  are  called  with
       buffers of these samples, and buffer sizes which refer to the number of
       samples processed, not the number of bytes.  File readers translate the
       input  samples  to signed 32-bit integers and return the number of sam-
       ples read.  For example, data in linear signed  byte  format  is  left-
       shifted 24 bits.

       Representing samples as integers can cause problems when processing the
       audio.  For example, if an effect to mix down left and  right  channels
       into one monophonic channel were to use the line

          *obuf++ = (*ibuf++ + *ibuf++)/2;

       distortion  might occur since the intermediate addition can overflow 32
       bits.  The line

          *obuf++ = *ibuf++/2 + *ibuf++/2;

       would get round the overflow problem (at the expense of the least  sig-
       nificant bit).

       Stereo  data  is stored with the left and right speaker data in succes-
       sive samples.  Quadraphonic data is stored in this order:  left  front,
       right front, left rear, right rear.

FORMATS
       A  format is responsible for translating between sound sample files and
       an internal buffer.  The internal buffer is store in signed longs  with
       a fixed sampling rate.  The format operates from two data structures: a
       format structure, and a private structure.

       The format structure contains a list of control parameters for the sam-
       ple:  sampling rate, data size (8, 16, or 32 bits), encoding (unsigned,
       signed, floating point, etc.), number of sound channels.  It also  con-
       tains  other  state  information:  whether  the sample file needs to be
       byte-swapped, whether sox_seek() will work, its suffix, its file stream
       pointer, its format pointer, and the private structure for the format .

       The private area is just a preallocated data array for  the  format  to
       use  however  it  wishes.   It should have a defined data structure and
       cast the array to that structure.  See voc.c for the use of  a  private
       data area.  Voc.c has to track the number of samples it writes and when
       finishing, seek back to the beginning of the file  and  write  it  out.
       The  private  area  is not very large.  The ``echo'' effect has to mal-
       loc() a much larger area for its delay line buffers.

       A format has 6 routines:

       startread           Set up the format parameters, or  read  in  a  data
                           header, or do what needs to be done.

       read                Given  a  buffer and a length: read up to that many
                           samples, transform them into signed long  integers,
                           and  copy  them into the buffer.  Return the number
                           of samples actually read.

       stopread            Do what needs to be done.

       startwrite          Set up the format parameters, or write out  a  data
                           header, or do what needs to be done.

       write               Given a buffer and a length: copy that many samples
                           out of the buffer, convert them from  signed  longs
                           to  the  appropriate  data,  and  write them to the
                           file.  If it can't write out all the samples, fail.

       stopwrite           Fix  up  any  file  header,  or do what needs to be
                           done.

EFFECTS
       Each effect runs with one input and one  output  stream.   An  effect's
       implementation comprises six functions that may be called to the follow
       flow diagram:

       LOOP (invocations with different parameters)
         getopts
         LOOP (invocations with the same parameters)
           LOOP (channels)
             start
           LOOP (whilst there is input audio to process)
             LOOP (channels)
               flow
           LOOP (whilst there is output audio to generate)
             LOOP (channels)
               drain
           LOOP (channels)
             stop
         kill

       Notes: For some effects, some of the functions may not  be  needed  and
       can  be  NULL.   An effect that is marked `MCHAN' does not use the LOOP
       (channels) lines and must therefore perform multiple channel processing
       inside  the  affected functions.  Multiple effect instances may be pro-
       cessed (according to the above flow diagram) in parallel.

       getopts             is called with a character string argument list for
                           the effect.

       start               is  called with the signal parameters for the input
                           and output streams.

       flow                is called with input and output data  buffers,  and
                           (by  reference)  the  input  and output data buffer
                           sizes.  It processes the input buffer into the out-
                           put buffer, and sets the size variables to the num-
                           bers of samples actually processed.  It is under no
                           obligation  to  read from the input buffer or write
                           to the output buffer during the same call.  If  the
                           call returns SOX_EOF then this should be used as an
                           indication that this effect will no longer read any
                           data  and  can  be  used  to  switch  to drain mode
                           sooner.

       drain               is called after there are no more input  data  sam-
                           ples.   If  the effect wishes to generate more data
                           samples it copies the generated data into  a  given
                           buffer and returns the number of samples generated.
                           If it fills the buffer, it will  be  called  again,
                           etc.  The echo effect uses this to fade away.

       stop                is  called when there are no more input samples and
                           no more output samples to process.  It is typically
                           used  to release or close resources (e.g. allocated
                           memory or temporary  files)  that  were  set-up  in
                           start.  See echo.c for an example.

       kill                is  called  to allow resources allocated by getopts
                           to be released.  See pad.c for an example.

LINKING
       The method of linking against libsox depends on how SoX  was  built  on
       your  system.  For  a  static build, just link against the libraries as
       normal. For a dynamic build, you should use libtool to  link  with  the
       correct  linker  flags.  See the libtool manual for details; basically,
       you use it as:

          libtool --mode=link gcc -o prog /path/to/libsox.la
